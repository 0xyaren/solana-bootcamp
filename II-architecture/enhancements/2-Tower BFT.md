On top of Proof of History, Solana runs **Tower Consensus**, a PBFT-like consensus algorithm specifically designed to take advantage of the synchronized clock. Unlike PBFT, Tower Consensus prefers liveness over consistency. Like PBFT, nodes exponentially increase their timeouts to come to an agreement, but because the ledger is also a trustless source of time, nodes can observe and examine timeouts of all the other validators in the network. To better understand, let’s consider an example:

Imagine that you are on an island, and a bottle floats by with a thumb drive. Inside the drive is a Solana ledger. If you just look at the ledger itself, you will see that each node can compute the number of validators present, the state of each validator, and critically, the timeout each validator has committed to any block in the network. Based on the data structure alone, without any peer-to-peer messages, a validator can make the decision to vote, and the network can come to consensus.
